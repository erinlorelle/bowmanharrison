Bowman Harrison Realtor website prototype

Real Estate website prototype for mother-daughter realtor looking to increase their online presence and also promote their staging services.  The site features buying and selling guides, regional information, and staging details.  The site features sample listings since access to MLS data was not available.  This site was part of a contest with other sites and was preferred due to it's visual appeal and customization.  The clients ultimately went with WordPress so they could update without hired help.
